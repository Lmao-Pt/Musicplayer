[00:12.24]This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
[00:18.09]No silent prayer for the faith-departed
[00:23.93]I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
[00:26.81]You're gonna hear my voice
[00:28.06]When I shout it out loud
[00:30.76]It's my life
[00:32.64]It's now or never
[00:35.08]I ain't gonna live forever
[00:38.15]I just want to live while I'm alive
[00:43.06]It's my life
[00:44.70]My heart is like an open highway
[00:46.90]Like Frankie said
[00:48.49]I did it my way
[00:50.23]I just wanna live while I'm alive
[00:54.10]It's my life
[01:02.16]This is for the ones who stood their ground
[01:07.35]For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
[01:13.38]Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
[01:16.14]Luck ain't even lucky
[01:17.83]Got to make your own breaks
[01:20.33]It's my life
[01:22.20]It's now or never
[01:24.68]I ain't gonna live forever
[01:27.72]I just want to live while I'm alive
[01:32.27]It's my life
[01:33.86]My heart is like an open highway
[01:36.54]Like Frankie said
[01:37.66]I did it my way
[01:39.81]I just wanna live while I'm alive
[01:43.54]it's my life
